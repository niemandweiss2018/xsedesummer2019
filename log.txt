---------- INFORMATION ----------

Book: Deep Learning with Python

---------- LOG ----------

Monday (6/10)

Meeting: Talked about how opencv can be used with images. Also discussed the importance of normilizing images 
before feeding them into a network.
Day's Work: Worked through Chapter 5. Completed first convnet neural network and achieved accuracy of .9922 versus .9706!

Tuesday (6/11)

Day's Work: Progress was made on image preprocessing for dogs and cats example from chapter 5. Became comfortable working with
os and shutil packages to manipulate the local file system. Setup train, validation, and test directories with 2000, 1000,
and 1000 images respectively of pets(dogs and cats).

Wednesday (6/12)

Day's Work: Watched some videos on Convnets to better understand how they work.
Read beginning of chapter 5 again in order to better understand convnets. Things
are not really making sense yet.

Friday(6/14)

Day's Work: Setup cats and dogs convnet and trained the network. Played around
with settings of the model and layers to see if I could fix the accuracy issue.
Book says I should be getting nearly 100% accuracy and a case of overfitting but
my model is only reaching 49% accuracy.

Sunday (6/16)

Day's Work: Still cannot figure out why cats and dogs network is not working right.
Going to have to ask Dr. Liu in the next meeting for help with this. Still not
really comfortable with convnets and I feel like I am just typing what is in 
the book and not fully understanding it. Changed number of epochs to 10 because
model seems to be lossing accuracy with the recommended 30 epochs. Accuracy
peaks at epoch #6. Convnet saved to ./dogcat_bad.h5

Monday (6/17)

Meeting: Met with Dr. Liu (Hood) and Dr. Liu (NIH) to discuss moving on from chapter 5. 
Task for the day is to download medical x-ray images and move them into folders
based on their classification (what was found wrong on them). Instructed to use python
script to download images on the server and then extract classification phenotypes
based off of the .csv file that comes with the images.

Day's Work: Downloaded and extracted image files. Started to work on preprocessing images
by dividing them up based on their labels. Python code was not working 100% at the end of
the day.

Tuesday (6/18)

Meeting: Talked about different ways to work with csv files in python. I was using os and 
shutil but Dr. Liu recommended that I use pandas or numpy to work with such large datasets.

Day's Work: Not much

Wednesday (6/19)

Day's Work: Finished preprocessing script and uploaded to the server. Stil trying to figure
out how the images need to be classified in order to build a model around them. Hamid and I
will have questions for tomorrow's meeting so we can better understand what is going on.
